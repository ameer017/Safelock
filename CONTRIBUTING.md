2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cartridge.git
   cd cartridge
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

## Development Workflow

### Running the Project

- **Development mode**: `npm run dev`
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Run tests**: `npm test`
- **Run linting**: `npm run lint`
- **Type checking**: `npm run type-check`

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type checking
- **Jest**: Testing
- **Husky**: Git hooks
- **Commitlint**: Commit message validation

### Git Hooks

The project uses Husky to run pre-commit and pre-push hooks:

- **Pre-commit**: Runs lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier)
- **Commit-msg**: Validates commit message format
- **Pre-push**: Runs full validation (lint + type-check + tests)

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes

- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
