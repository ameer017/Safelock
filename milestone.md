# 🛡️ SafeLock Project Milestones

## 📛 Project Name
**SafeLock** — A decentralized contingency platform for savings, transfers, and swaps with time-locked discipline.

## 📝 Description
SafeLock is a Web3-native savings and contingency platform where users can:
- Save money with time-locked smart contracts
- Send/receive funds instantly via human-readable addresses
- Swap between tokens seamlessly
- Face penalties for early withdrawals to encourage financial discipline

This creates a decentralized safety net that blends the security of DeFi with the accountability of traditional "fixed deposit" savings schemes.

## ❌ Problem Statement
- **Low savings culture**: Many people lack structured systems to save consistently
- **Impulse withdrawals**: Even when people save, they dip into funds too early, breaking their goals
- **Lack of trust in custodians**: Traditional banks or apps that offer locked savings are centralized, opaque, and prone to misuse
- **Cross-border inefficiency**: Sending/receiving money across countries is slow and costly

## ✅ Solution Statement
SafeLock solves this by building a decentralized, transparent, and disciplined financial layer:
- **Time-locked savings smart contracts**: Users set savings goals (e.g., 6 months) and can't withdraw early without penalty
- **Penalty → Pool Incentives**: Early withdrawal penalties are redistributed to other savers, rewarding discipline
- **Peer-to-peer transfers**: Send/receive funds across borders instantly, powered by ENS or EVM-compatible name service
- **Built-in swapping**: Users can swap stablecoins or native tokens directly within the app
- **Decentralized, no custodian**: All funds are managed by smart contracts, not middlemen

## 🎯 Mission
To empower individuals and communities to build financial discipline and resilience using decentralized technology, ensuring savings, remittances, and swaps are secure, borderless, and transparent.
